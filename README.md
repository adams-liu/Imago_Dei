this is a momentum clone but for Christians

##Current Schedule:

Week 1: (current week)
- Read through medium article for Chrome Extension. 
- Get HTML and CSS portion done and basic design 
- Have API for Unsplash and OpenWeatherMap, and Scripture API implemented (https://odb.org/2020/10/05/begin-with-the-end)

Week 2-3:
- Create a MongoDB database that stores the links to specific unsplash photos (id,type,user,link)
- Implement a Todo list option (probably going to use React?)
- Give users the abiltiy to toggle between % and actual time (maybe have a clever way to implement progress bar)
- When users tick off the boxes, then progress bar increases

Week 4: 
- Refactor code to make sure there are best practices
- Create README.md
- Deploy on Heroku
- Hopefully be able to deploy in on Chrome Store? (idk how that works yet)
